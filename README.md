# advent-of-code-2025

This repository contains my solutions and approaches for the Advent of Code 2025 challenges. Each `day` directory corresponds to a specific challenge, and within each day, you'll find the problem input, my solution script(s), and a high-level overview of how I tackled the problem.

## Getting Started

To explore the solutions:

1.  **Navigate to a specific day:** Each challenge's content is organized within its own directory, e.g., [`day1/`](day1/).
2.  **Review the challenge overview:** Inside each day's directory, a `README.md` file provides a high-level summary of the challenge and my general approach to solving it.
3.  **Examine the code:** The Python scripts (e.g., [`day1/rotation_calc.py`](day1/rotation_calc.py)) contain the implemented solution.
4.  **Check input data:** Input data for each day is typically found in a `.txt` file within the respective directory (e.g., [`day1/day1_rotations.txt`](day1/day1_rotations.txt)).

Feel free to explore and provide feedback!
